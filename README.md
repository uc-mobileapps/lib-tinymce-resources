This is the [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/) javascript deployment package used by the 
[TinyMCE for Vaadin editor library](https://uc-mobileapps.com/editor-tinymce-for-vaadin/).

Changes: 
* The themes folder had to be renamed to work with the latest Vaadin 14 LTS releases.

TinyMCE community edition is GNU LGPL licensed, hence any changes done in the library itself are made
available under the same license.
